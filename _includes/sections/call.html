<p class="text">ArgMining 2021 invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of argument mining. The workshop solicits LONG and SHORT papers for oral and poster presentations, as well as DEMOS of argument/argumentation mining systems and tools.</p>
The topics for submissions include but are not limited to:
  <ul>
<li>Automatic identification of argument components (e.g., premises and conclusions), and relations between arguments (e.g., support and attack) in as well as across documents</li>
<li>Automatic assessment of properties of arguments and argumentation, such as argumentation schemes, stance, quality, and persuasiveness</li>
<li>Creation and evaluation of argument annotation schemes, developing automatic and semi-automatic argument annotation methods and tools, and building high-quality annotated datasets, benchmarks, and Knowledge graphs</li>
<li>Automatic retrieval, summarization, and generation of arguments</li>
<li>Applications of argument mining and computational argumentation to various domains and data such as social sciences and humanities texts, legal and technical documents, scientific papers, news corpora, Wikipedia articles, consumer reviews, user-generated content, and students&rsquo; written essays.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">This year, the workshop plans to have a joint session with the workshop <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/codi-2021/">CODI (Computational Approaches to Discourse)</a>. Submissions that address argumentation from an angle that overlaps with discourse structure phenomena will be considered for that session. (Authors may but need not make this potential overlap explicit)</p>

<h4 class="my-3 ">Submission Information</h4>
Three types of papers can be submitted: Long papers (8 pages + references), short papers (4 pages + references), and demo papers (4 pages + references). Demo papers must include a URL to a running demo. Accepted papers will be given an additional page to account for the reviewers' comments. All papers will be treated equally in the workshop proceedings. The workshop follows <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation">ACL&rsquo;s policies</a> for submission, review, and citation. Moreover, authors are expected to adhere to the ethical code set out in the <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics">ACL Code of Ethics</a>. Submissions that violate any of the policies will be rejected without review.
<p class="text">Please use the EMNLP 2021 style sheets for formatting your paper: <a href="https://2021.emnlp.org">https://2021.emnlp.org/</a> <br />

    </p><p class="text">The workshop is running a double-blind review process. In preparing your manuscript, do not include any information which could reveal your identity, or that of your co-authors. The title section of your manuscript should not contain any author names, email addresses, or affiliation status. If you do include any author names on the title page, your submission will be automatically rejected. In the body of your submission, you should eliminate all direct references to your own previous work. That is, avoid phrases such as "this contribution generalizes our results for XYZ". Also, please do not disproportionately cite your own previous work. In other words, make your submission as anonymous as possible. We need your cooperation in our effort to maintain a fair, double-blind reviewing process - and to consider all submissions equally. Double Submission Papers that have been or will be submitted to other venues should indicate this at submission time. Upon acceptance at either event, the submission must be withdrawn from the other. To save reviewers' efforts, avoid submitting (or withdraw early) papers that are on track to be accepted elsewhere.</p>
